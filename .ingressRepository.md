# A writeup on ingressing a repository with history

Below is the message I wrote to the Code Fellows 201n16 class slack channel



Not sure if anybody else did this, but I started off using GitHub by creating a new repository for every lab project (busmall, salmon cookies, chocolate pizza, so on). Considering I retook the class, I ended up with twice the repos, and I now have a whole bunch of repos cluttering up my account, and that has been driving me mad. So I've finally done something about it, and I've begun consolidating my repos into distinct class repos. What's great, and this was a must for me, is that the new repos contain all the commit history of the repos that are merged into it.For those like me, here's a writeup on how to do the same. Please note that this was performed in the ubuntu linux subsystem for windows. This should be exactly the same for those on a linux machine, and likely very similar for those on a mac, if not the same. Also, as long as you don't deviate from these steps, this writeup does not include any steps that will make you lose any work. That is especially great for pair-programming labs where the original repository belongs to the partner. Except for step 19, which has some suggestions on what to do with your old repositories after you're done.1) From github.com create a new repository from the + icon in the top right corner.
2) Name the repository whatever you wish, try to use something descriptive (such as CodeFellows_201n16). Add a description if you would like, this is of course optional.
3) Leave all other settings alone, unless you want this repository to be private at this time. This is important and will help to avoid merge conflicts.
4) Clone this new repository using 'git clone' into the location of your choosing, and move into it.
5) Create a new directory using 'mkdir [NAME]'. A good idea for a name is whatever the project was called that you're going to consolidate next, like busMall or salmonCookies. You don't need to enter this directory, just create it.
6) Copy the URL of the repository you want to consolidate into that directory.
7) Make sure that in your terminal, you are in the directory of your new repository.
8) 'git remote add -f [oldRepo] <oldRepo URL>' Use any short name for the old repo in [oldRepo].
9) 'git merge [oldRepo]/master --allow-unrelated-histories' Use the same name created in step 8. You must use the '--allow-unrelated-histories' to successfully merge here.
10) If you created a README.md file or a different license when you created this new repository, you will be required to fix the merge conflicts locally in order to proceed. If so, take care of them in your code editor, then 'git add .' and 'git commit -m "[commit message]"' to proceed.
11) You may be required to enter a merge message here. If so, it will automatically enter you into a text editor. Enter whatever you would like for this message. If you're in the default text editor, you can then press 'ctrl + x', then 'y', then 'enter', and you should be on your way.
12) At this point, all of the files from your old repository have now been merged into this repository, including the commit history in GitHub! You'll now need to do some housekeeping before repeating these steps for another repo.
13) You'll want to use 'ls -a' to view all files and directories, as some are hidden.
14) Identify which files and directories need to be moved into their new home. Ones that you should NOT move are '.git/' and any new directories you've created to hold your projects.
15) You can move all of the files and directories in one command. The format is 'mv [source]... [destination]' and you can name as many sources as you want. Just make sure that the destination foler is last. Here's an example:
'mv README.md index.html .gitignore LICENSE css/ js/ .eslintrc.json Media/ aboutMe/'
In this example, I use 'mv' to call the move command, and I move 'README.md index.html .gitignore LICENSE css/ js/ .eslintrc.json Media/' (all of my sources) into 'aboutMe/' (my destination).
16) Now you should perform an A-C-P to save all your changes and update the repo in GitHub.
17) You have now created a new repository and copied another into it, with its history, and placed it in a new home.
18) To bring in a new repository, repeat steps 5-16.
19) Once you have made a new home for all the repositories you wish to consolidate, it's up to you what you want to do with the old repositories. A few options are to archive them, delete them, make them private, or leave them. Personally, I created a second account to archive them and transferred ownership.
20) You're almost done. Now you should create a README.md and a LICENSE for your new repository. For the license, you can copy a license from any of the repositories you consolidated. We were advised to use the MIT license, so that's likely what you'll have ready to copy. You are now done at this point.Something you may be interested in doing afterwards is setting up a deployed site that links to each of the pages. It should be easy enough for any of us (we ARE software developers!) to whip up a simple index.html page with links to each of the labs' index.html pages.
