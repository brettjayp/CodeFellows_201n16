- Had to UNfactor my guessing game code. Lab requirements state do not use a function, as that is out-of-scope of what we've been taught thus far. This resulted in an annoying amount of work to add like 150 lines of code. Very annoying for me, SO lesson learned.
- Added question six, a guessing game to guess a random number. I've done something similar before, so I worked hard to make this better. It returns more information to the user that should help them guess the correct number more oftern.
- Added question seven, a guessing game where you guess a value that is in an array of possible answers. I used .indexOf(), which may be 'out-of-scope', but I do feel good about using it because I took the time to teach other classmates the logic behind .indexOf() on the whiteboard in terms of what they would be using otherwise. I gave them the logic using in-scope terms.
- Added a very easy tally system for the game.
