Problem Domain

Pat’s Salmon Cookies problem domain can be found here!
Instructions

Continue working on the functionality of your sales.html page if you do not have it working 100% yet, including the row of totals across the bottom.

Pat has provided you 7 additional images that they would like to see on the home page of the site. These images are located in your daily class GitHub repo: class-09/lab-b/assets/.

Your public-facing index.html page should include the following:

    locations with addresses,
    hours open
    contact information
    Anything else you feel neccesary.

Feel free to make this information up. Get creative, have fun, but remember to be professional.
Stretch Goals

    Add the ability for your users to choose among multiple display or color profiles for the page. Clicking a button should allow them to choose (for instance) whether the text is dark on a light background, or the text is light on a dark background. You can also experiment with changing up the style: make a version of your display that mimics a newspaper, or an Excel spreadsheet, or Roman chiseling in stone. (But make sure the user can choose a more normal style, too!) You can also experiment with using a select input to choose the style.
    Give your input form functionality to update the data for a location that is already in the table. This is going to require some additional pieces, such as:
        Some kind of if statement to test whether the inputted cookie stand location name matches one that is already in the table (or other mechanism to indicate which location to update)
        The new input numbers need to be run through the calculation methods as with the original creation of the instances

    Make a style guide, using this one that a team Brian was on made for Everlast as a model.
    Make two additional pages:
        Mock up an order form that would be public facing (store.html) so that visitors to the website can order salmon cookies and swag. That form would need to receive all of the things you’d expect on an order form: name, address, payment info, products to order, quantities, special instructions, and so on.
        A second ‘private’ page (order-processing.html) that shows a list of pending orders and the individual order details. The business owner can then process the orders by clicking a button next to the order that then moves that list item to a ‘Filled Orders’ list at the bottom of the page.
